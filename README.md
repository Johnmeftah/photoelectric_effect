# Photoelectric Effect Virtual Experiment 
This repository contains a virtual experiment designed to showcase the Photoelectric Effect in quantum mechanics, illustrating how light can exhibit both wave-like and particle-like behaviors.

# Background
Historically, the wave model of light suggested that:
Increasing the amplitude (or intensity) of light would elevate the kinetic energy of emitted photoelectrons.
Boosting the frequency of light would enhance the current.
However, experimental results contradicted these predictions:
Elevating the light's frequency increased the kinetic energy of the emitted photoelectrons.
Raising the light's amplitude augmented the photoelectric current.
In response to these findings, Albert Einstein proposed that light behaves as a stream of discrete particles termed "photons." The energy of each photon is given by:
E = hν
Where:
E is the energy of the photon.
h is Planck's constant.
ν is the frequency of light.

# Work Function
The work function (Φ) is the minimal energy required to induce photoemission of electrons from a metal surface, and it's intrinsic to the particular metal.
For an electron to be emitted:
E_photon = KE_electron + Φ

# Emitters Used
In this experiment, we employed carbon and iron as emitters.
